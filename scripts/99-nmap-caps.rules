# Udev rule to set nmap capabilities after install.
# Install: sudo cp scripts/99-nmap-caps.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
#          sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
#
# Note: udev rules trigger on device events, not binary installs.
# This rule grants /dev/net/tun access to the 'nmap' group for tunnel scans.
# For raw socket capabilities, use: sudo scripts/setup-caps.sh

# Allow members of the 'nmap' group to use /dev/net/tun without sudo
